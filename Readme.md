**HTML and CSS Practice**
* Two directories included.
* One with the first time code i had written with alot of mitakes.
* As it was my first time writing code for a whole webpage to practice HTML, CSS . 
* Styled with basic CSS (paddings ,margins, an so on).
* The other one is a little bit upgraded version of the same proj(webpage) that uses selectors, flexbox, * CSS grids and (a little bit of) media queries.
